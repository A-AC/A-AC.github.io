			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello there! My name is Alejandro Armida Cortes, and I am an aspiring engineer engineering and the endless possibilities it offers. Currently pursuing a 
				Bachelor's degree in Robotics and Digital System Engineering, I am on a mission to merge my engineering expertise with my keen eye for aesthetics.</p>

			<p>While my academic focus lies in robotics and digital systems, I have always found inspiration in the creative aspects of engineering. I believe that technology
				not only serves a functional purpose but also has the power to captivate and inspire. With a unique blend of technical skills and artistic sensibility, I strive
				to create engineering solutions that are not only efficient and innovative but also visually striking.</p>

			<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have immersed myself in various areas of engineering, tackling challenges in AI, robotics, software development, control systems, 
				microcontrollers, and computer architecture. This broad range of experiences has provided me with a diverse skill set, enabling me to approach problems from multiple 
				angles and find innovative solutions.</p>

			<p>My artistic side finds particular joy in the intersection of form and function. I am deeply fascinated by the challenge of designing robotic systems that not only 
				perform complex tasks but also possess an inherent beauty in their interactions and implementation. The ability to merge the precision of engineering with the 
				gracefulness of art truly motivates me.</p>

			<p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I actively nurture my creative spirit through various artistic endeavors. Whether it is through sketching, or graphic design, 
				I find freedom in expressing my ideas visually and exploring the world of aesthetics. This artistic inclination not only fuels my engineering work but also allows me 
				to approach problem-solving with a fresh perspective, resulting in innovative and visually appealing solutions.</p>

			<p>I thrive in collaborative environments where different disciplines come together to create something extraordinary. Working in teams that value diverse perspectives 
				allows me to leverage my artistic sensibilities to contribute unique insights and push the boundaries of what is considered both technically impressive and aesthetically 
				pleasing.</p>

			<p>As I embark on my professional journey, I am excited to combine my engineering expertise, artistic flair, and dedication to creating beautiful and functional solutions. 
				Whether it is through designing mesmerizing robotic systems, crafting visually engaging user interfaces, or integrating artistry into engineering projects, 
				I am committed to making a lasting impact that seamlessly blends technology and beauty.</p>

			<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I eagerly look forward to connecting with individuals who share my passion for engineering, aesthetics, 
				and the pursuit of creating harmonious and inspiring experiences through innovative technology.</p>
